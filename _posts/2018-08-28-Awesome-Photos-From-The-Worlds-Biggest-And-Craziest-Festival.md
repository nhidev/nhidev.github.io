Burning Man 2018 takes place August 26 – September 3, 2018 in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada. Participants join in the effort to co-create Black Rock City, a temporary metropolis dedicated to art and community. Burning Man isn’t your usual festival. It’s a city wherein almost everything that happens is created entirely by its citizens, who are active participants in the experience.

As tens of thousands of burners pour into the pop-up city, which will culminate on Sunday with the ignition of the titular man, a bevy of nifty structures and art pieces sprout up on the sand. Each year, dozens and dozens of shrines and installations rise over the week, encircling this year’s theme of “I, Robot.”

Today we showcase the beautiful creations happening at Burning Man. Everything from ships, pop-art cars, illuminated skateboards, towering structures, and the fiery man himself will make an appearance.
