There’s something undeniably romantic about tossing a message into the ocean and 
seeing to whom fate — abetted by the currents and wind — might deliver the marine missive.

```
How will it be if build an social application, but without friend list, group, fan page, follower and following, no advertising, no news.

SO EXACTLY WHAT WILL IT USE FOR?  
Sharing!! You feel angry, frustrated, depressed, guity, happy..., things you can't or don't want to share with your friends, famaly, lovers, or simple you want to shout it out, share with someone... strangers.

HOW WIL IT LOOK LIKE?
```
Dropping a message: 	     
- Write it  
- Select (picture, song, video)  
- Upload your own  

Random pick up a message: 
- [Reply]  
- [Click icon] maybe :fire: or :heart:  things with mean you know that feeling  
- [Leave it] when you can't say any good word better leave it there.   

Your trunk:
- List of messages, i would like to show them as the bottles on the shelf, or hanging on.   
When you recive a reply or icon, it will light up or shake.
```
Some another functions like direct message/chat.  

WHO WANT TO USE IT?
